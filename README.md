# Rust Recipes üç≥ [![build](https://github.com/char16t/rust-recipes/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/char16t/rust-recipes/actions/workflows/build.yml) ![coverage](https://char16t.github.io/rust-recipes/badges/flat.svg)

## Motivation

This repository contains implementations of algorithms and some data structures in Rust. All of them are implemented without dependencies, using only the standard Rust library. They can be used as building blocks for implementing more complex algorithms or programs. In most cases, all implementations consist of simple syntactic constructs available in imperative programming languages, so they are relatively easy to rewrite in another programming language.

In today's world of software development, programs are overgrown with many layers of abstractions from frameworks and ready-made libraries, but the main work is done by the small code size and functionality of the kernel. Superfluous abstractions lead to the fact that as the computing power of computers grows, our programs consume more and more computing resources while doing the same things they did 10 years ago.

Small or structurally simple programs written from scratch are easier to understand, maintain, fix, and analyze their performance. They are also much less expensive in terms of the infrastructure used to run them.

Use this repository to look up an implementation of an algorithm, understand it better and use it in your project. All implementations are covered by tests, so you can be sure in which situations they will work (or write a test for your own case and quickly check).
